1. Change table prefix in wp-config.php to random generated.

2. Secure wp-includes by adding the following to .htaccess â€“ note that this should go outside '# BEGIN WordPress' and '# END WordPress' tags as WP can overwrite anything within those.

# Block the include-only files.
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^wp-admin/includes/ - [F,L]
RewriteRule !^wp-includes/ - [S=3]
RewriteRule ^wp-includes/[^/]+\.php$ - [F,L]
RewriteRule ^wp-includes/js/tinymce/langs/.+\.php - [F,L]
RewriteRule ^wp-includes/theme-compat/ - [F,L]

# BEGIN WordPress

3. Secure wp-config.php by moving it outside the site. You can move the wp-config.php file to the directory above your WordPress install. This means for a site installed in the root of your webspace, you can store wp-config.php outside the web-root folder. 

4. Disable file editing within the admin area by adding the following to wp-config.php:

/** Disable admin editing of files. */
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);

5. Make 'admin' username something other than 'admin'.

6. Don't post as admin, post as contributor and publish with admin.

7. Use strong passwords.

/ 
    The root WordPress directory: all files should be writable only by your user account, except .htaccess if you want WordPress to automatically generate rewrite rules for you. 

/wp-admin/ 
    The WordPress administration area: all files should be writable only by your user account. 

/wp-includes/ 
    The bulk of WordPress application logic: all files should be writable only by your user account. 

/wp-content/ 
    User-supplied content: intended to be completely writable by all users (owner/user, group, and public). 

Within /wp-content/ you will find:

/wp-content/themes/ 
    Theme files. If you want to use the built-in theme editor, all files need to be group writable. If you do not want to use the built-in theme editor, all files can be writable only by your user account. 

/wp-content/plugins/ 
    Plugin files: all files should be writable only by your user account. 

Other directories that may be present with /wp-content/ should be documented by whichever plugin or theme requires them. Permissions may vary.
